get_next_line is a project from the 42 curriculum that aims to implement a function capable of reading a line from a file descriptor, one line at a time, without losing the reading progress between calls. The goal is to understand and manage static variables, memory allocation, and efficient buffer handling in C. The function get_next_line() must return each line exactly as it appears in the file, including the newline character, until the end of the file is reached. This project builds a strong foundation for mastering file I/O, dynamic memory management, and string manipulation â€” essential concepts for all future C programming at 42.
